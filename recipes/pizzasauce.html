        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I decided to use Marcella Hazan's famous tomato sauce recipe in lieu of a traditional American-style marinara. The result was far greater than the sum of its parts. In this recipe, frankness is overshadowed by utilizing quality ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes or fresh garden tomatoes) and patience. You simmer the tomatoes, along with halved onions, in a saucepan with butter, gently simmering for up to 45 minutes. </p>
        <p>Do not rush this recipe. Undercooking the tomatoes means that you may not develop as rich a flavor. Once the sauce has simmered, discard the onion. Marcella's recipe doesn't call for it, but I like to add a few stalks of torn basil to my sauce at the end. This ensures that the freshness of the herbs stay intact. Allow the sauce to cool completely before using on pizza dough.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes OR 2 pounds of fresh tomatoes (do not use Roma or hothouse)</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, peeled and halved</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the tomatoes, butter, onion halves, and a pinch of salt in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring and crushing the tomatoes lightly with the back of a spoon occasionally, until droplets of fat appear on the surface of the tomatoes, about 45 minutes. Remove and discard the onion and add basil.</li>
        </ol>
